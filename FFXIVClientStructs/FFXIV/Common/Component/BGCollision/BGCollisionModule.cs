/// <summary>
/// Entry point for collision related operations.
/// Collision scene supports two ways to filter colliders - layers and material masks.
///
/// Each collider, when constructed, is provided a layer mask. Collider is ignored during raycasts if raycast request layer mask AND collider layer mask == 0.
/// Note that individual collider raycast operations are inconsistent in how they handle zero layer mask in raycast request:
/// - primitive shape (non-mesh) colliders skip layer check in that case (so 0 is equivalent to 'all 1s' mask, meaning no colliders are rejected by layer check)
/// - mesh colliders do a normal check, meaning that all mesh colliders are rejected by a layer check
/// Note that some colliders provide functions to perform raycast without layer check.
///
/// Each collider also has a material value (0x7000 by default on construction). When doing raycasts with material filtering, you supply a mask and a value.
/// For primitive shape (non-mesh) colliders, the filtering is simple:
/// - if material filter value is 0, the collider is considered if (collider-material AND filter-mask) != 0
/// - otherwise, the collider is considered if (collider-material AND filter-mask) == filter-value
/// For mesh colliders, things are slightly more complicated. Collider still contains a material value + a material mask (this mask is ignored by all other collider types).
/// Each individual triangle of the mesh also defines its own material value (primitive material). The effective material of a triangle is calculated as follows:
/// - if object material mask is 0, it's just whatever is stored in primitive
/// - otherwise, it is calculated as (primitive-material AND NOT object-material-mask) OR object-material-value (so masked bits are replaced by per-object value)
/// This effective material is then used as collider-material value in the material filtering logic described above.
///
/// There are three main options that are used to customize raycast algorithm - these are stored as 'raycast algorithm type' bitfield, meaning there are 8 total flavours of raycasts:
/// Default (no bits set): usual ray/shape intersection without material filtering.
/// Bit 0 set: use sphere sweep instead of a ray; when choosing between potential intersection points at comparable (within epsilon) distance, select one that has 'more orthogonal' normal (smaller ray-direction dot normal)
/// Bit 1 set: ignore 'horizontal' collisions (ones where normal.Y is > threshold, i.e. angle to vertical axis is smaller than some threshold)
/// Bit 2 set: perform material filtering
/// </summary>
