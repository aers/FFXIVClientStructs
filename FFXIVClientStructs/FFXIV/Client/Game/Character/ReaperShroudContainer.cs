// Reaper Shroud seems to be mostly hardcoded.
// It applies a transformation to NpcEquip row 2161 (which only sets the body slot to 8100,1).
// It also enables the Vfx in this container, and toggles the 'atr_eye_a' attribute in the model (for the red pupils).
// We do not actually know where all the other values come in, nothing except Flags and Vfx is actually used by Reaper Shroud (not even NpcEquipId, strangely).
// This probably is used by other transformations too, but we have not found any yet.

// Client::Game::Character::ReaperShroudContainer
